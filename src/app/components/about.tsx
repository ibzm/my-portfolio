        I&apos;m Isaac, a second-year Software Engineering student at Sheffield Hallam University. I am passionate about
        programming and have been learning and applying various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and C#.
        Throughout my education, I have gained valuable experience in building projects, collaborating in teams, and solving
        real-world problems. I&apos;m looking forward to my upcoming placement year to apply these skills in the industry.
